All you need to do is insert your specific parameters, and you can test the calls from the command line. See this tutorial on\\nusing cURL with APIs\\n.\\nRequests and Response\\n\\u200b\\nBoth request body data and response data are formatted as JSON. Content type for responses will always be\\napplication/json\\n. Generally, all responses will be in the following format:\\nResponse format\\n{\\n\"success\"\\n:\\n[\\nboolean\\n]\\n,\\n// Only true if the details provided could be processed and no error occured while processing\\n\"message\"\\n:\\n[\\nstring\\n]\\n,\\n// Explains why status is false... Entirely informational. Please only log this but do not use for your checks\\n\"data\"\\n:\\n[\\nobject\\n]\\n// contains actionable result of processing if present\\n}\\nWhile, it could be useful to use HTTP status codes to determine the result of an API call, we have provided a handy\\nsuccess\\nkey to let you know upfront if the request was successful or not.\\nThe\\nmessage\\nkey is a string which will contain a summary of the response and its status. For instance when trying to retrieve a list of customers, message might read “Customers retrieved”. In the event of an error, the message key will contain a description of the error as with the authorization header situation above. This is the only key that is universal across requests.\\nThe\\ndata\\nkey is where you want to look for the result of your request. It can either be an object, or an array depending on the request made. For instance, a request to retrieve a single customer will return a customer object in the data key, while the key would be an array of customers if a list is requested instead.\\nWallets\\n\\u200b\\nYou can get your wallet balance using the endpoint below. You\\'re advised as well to set a wallet threshold limit so you can get notified via email whenever your balance goes below the set limit to avoid service disruption.\\nResponse format\\n---\\ncurl\\n--location --request GET\\n\\'https://api.creditchek.africa/v1/wallet/\\'\\n\\\\\\n--header\\n\\'Authorization: Bearer nAuuVJ2T2TokentNoOcqBpSf1TokenwIJyTSIFDTokenMchQXb44Token5GyKG\\'\\n---\\nErrors\\n\\u200b\\nAs stated earlier, CreditChek\\'s API is RESTful and as such, uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.\\nFor more enquries, please reach out us @\\nE-mail:\\n[email\\xa0protected]\\nLast updated\\non\\nOct 13, 2023\\nPrevious\\nIntroduction\\nNext\\nWebhooks\\nSample Requests\\nRequests and Response\\nWallets\\nErrors\\nHelp\\nYouTube\\nEmail\\nCommunity\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nMore\\nBlog\\nCopyright © 2025 CreditChek Inc.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.creditchek.africa/webhook'}, page_content='Webhooks | CreditChek Docs\\nSkip to main content\\nDocs\\nBlog\\nGitHub\\nIntroduction\\nAuthentication\\nWebhooks\\nCredit Assessment SDK\\nNigeria 🇳🇬\\nKenya 🇰🇪\\nWebhooks\\nOn this page\\nWebhooks\\nCreditChek uses Webhooks to communicate updates on requests initiated with our API for you to kick off additional workflows based on these events. Due to credit bureau downtime or services that takes time for a response, CreditChek submits a POST request to the designated Webhook URL with updates about the transaction.\\nYour endpoint should respond to webhooks as quickly as possible. To acknowledge receipt of a webhook, your endpoint must return a 2xx HTTP status code. This status code should only indicate receipt of the message, not an acknowledgement that it was successfully processed by your system. Any other information returned in the response headers or response body is ignored.\\nSecurity\\n\\u200b\\nAll Webhook requests are sent with a\\nx-auth-signature\\nheader for verification.

12345678902\\nThis endpoint is designed to facilitate BVN validation, allowing customers to verify their Bank Verification Number (BVN) by providing specific information. In order to validate their BVN, merchants are required to enter the BVN number, indicate the type of call they wish to make, select a verification method that suits their preference, choosing between the available options of \"email\", \"phone\", or \"all\". Then they input a channel which includes a string of the contact to receive the One-Time Password (OTP), and enter the OTP sent to the chosen channel.\\nThis new system is to enable the collection of consent directly from the BVN holder, ensuring that their personal information is protected and their banking transactions are secure. Overall, the endpoint serves as a valuable tool for ensuring the accuracy and security of banking information.\\nRequest Parameters\\n\\u200b\\nName\\nPosition\\nRequired\\nDescription\\ntoken\\nHeaders\\nTrue\\napp public key\\nbvn\\nbody\\nTrue\\nuser Bank Verification Number\\nverification_method\\nbody\\nFalse\\npreferred medium for users to recieve otp, options are \"email\" or \"phone\" and default is \"all\"\\nmode\\nbody\\nTrue\\nThis is used to indicate the particular type of call you want to make and can be set to either of these; INITIATE, SET_CHANNEL, FINALIZE\\nchannel\\nbody\\nFalse\\nString of the contact to recieve OTP\\notp\\nbody\\nFalse\\nThe One-Time-Password received via email or phone number as chosen\\nExample Request\\n---\\ncurl\\n--location\\n\\'https://dev.creditchek.africa/v1/identity/bvn-verifcation/igree\\'\\n\\\\\\n--header\\n\\'token: {{token}}\\'\\n\\\\\\n--header\\n\\'Content-Type: application/json\\'\\n\\\\\\n--data\\n\\'{\\n\"bvn\": \"22339999601\",\\n\"mode\": \"INITIATE\",\\n\"channel\": \"0815***8883\",\\n\"otp\": \"1234\"\\n}\\'\\n---\\nSample Responses\\n\\u200b\\nINITIATE Response\\n{\\n\"status\"\\n:\\ntrue\\n,\\n\"data\"\\n:\\n{\\n\"detail\"\\n:\\n\"These are the contact details tied to your BVN.

solution built for businesses offering diverse lending, embedded finance, or post-paid services; it has an automated direct debit payment capability that allows merchants to collect payments directly from customers’ bank accounts by leveraging the nation’s bank transfer platform built for all forms of electronic payments (Internet banking portals and mobile banking apps), a suite of opt-in embedded credit-risk (insurance) tools that assures no merchant’s business fund is lost to bad debt.\\nThis is a faster, more reliable, and more secure way to recover payments from customers without entering their debit or credit card details. Before you can start using or integrating the RecovaPRO solution as a merchant, please note that you have to complete onboarding, and configure your merchant’s profile with custom settings on the CreditChek SaaS Portal.\\nAs a SaaS platform with the benefit of convenience to delivering timely speed to market, this solution is easily accessed or used via our dedicated Merchant’s Web Portal, as well as other integration channels into existing or new digital products.\\nThe following features are available in CreditChek’s RecovaPRO solution;\\nOne-time payments\\n\\u200b\\nOne-time debit empowers your business to secure full consent for executing a singular debit transaction from your customer's bank account. This option is ideal for scenarios where customers seek to make a single post-paid payment without engaging in any recurring commitments or intricate arrangements. For API or SDK integrations, upon the completion of a successful asynchronous payment transaction, a webhook is activated to verify the transaction status, enabling your platform to effortlessly receive real-time automated updates.\\nNOTE\\nThe minimum single direct debit value accepted and processed is N250.00\\nRecurring payments\\n\\u200b\\nThe Recurring debit payments feature caters to businesses with post-paid service models. Merchants can set up recurring payments of “fixed” or “variable” value in terms of amount, allowing customers to purchase your products or subscribe to your services easily. Also, managing subscription renewals and pay later (post-paid) services becomes seamless; and provides a hassle-free payment structure and debt recovery experience for your customers.\\nA suite of embedded Credit-Risk Management tools\\n\\u200b\\nThis suite of embedded credit risk management options guarantees that businesses with diverse post-paid service models never lose revenue, capital, or products to bad debts. As a merchant, while configuring your profile, you can opt-in for this value add-on service in your RecovaPRO custom profile, allowing your customers to purchase your product or subscribe to your services without fear of any potential business loss; and provide a hassle-free debt recovery experience for your customers. See more details about our\\nERM Add-on here\\n.\\nOpt-in automated Credit Reporting (to partner credit bureau)\\n\\u200b\\nA reliable value add-on, opt-in service to automate how diverse lenders or merchants can safely and conveniently automate reporting customers' lending(credit) and repayment behavior (activities) to our partner credit bureau in the same integration, from the same platform (a true all-in-one technology platform as a reliable lender’s choice 😉); without any hassle.\\nPayouts\\n\\u200b\\nAll business (merchants) requires a dependable method for ensuring the receipt of all recuperated merchant funds to sustain ongoing expansion reliably. Thus, it is easier to provide more credits, recover, “rinse, and repeat” without hassle when onward settlement is reliable and available during operational hours. Our platform allows merchants to request electronic payouts every Monday through Saturday (9 am to 6 pm). It guarantees to get funds in the setup or desired destination bank account (taxes and surcharges excluded) within an SLA(service level agreement) of two hours.\\nDispute Management\\n\\u200b\\nThe solution is designed to protect our diverse lenders and merchants in many undesirable business situations, thus the need to provide a dependable electronic communication channel to safely & transparently dispute cases such as wrong repayment, failed schedule, or recover any repayments from active/expired mandates with verifiable credit risk claims(event of force majeure, uncontrollable loss, and delinquencies) stemming from such non-performing debt.\\nProduct Management\\n\\u200b\\nThe solution is designed to aid merchants in automatically associating each e-Mandate to a specific product and optionally their preferred collection (settlement) bank account (add-on coming soon).\\nLast updated\\non\\nFeb 10, 2025\\nPrevious\\nRecovaPRO\\nNext\\nIntegration options\\nOne-time payments\\nRecurring payments\\nA suite of embedded Credit-Risk Management tools\\nOpt-in automated Credit Reporting (to partner credit bureau)\\nPayouts\\nDispute Management\\nProduct Management\\nHelp\\nYouTube\\nEmail\\nCommunity\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nMore\\nBlog\\nCopyright © 2025 CreditChek Inc.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.creditchek.africa/nigeria/recovaPro/integration'}, page_content=\"Integration options | CreditChek Docs\\nSkip to main content\\nDocs\\nBlog\\nGitHub\\nIntroduction\\nAuthentication\\nWebhooks\\nCredit Assessment SDK\\nNigeria 🇳🇬\\nIdentity Service\\nIncome Service\\nCredit Insights\\nRadar Service\\nERM\\nRecovaPRO\\nOverview\\nIntegration options\\nAPI\\nKenya 🇰🇪\\nNigeria 🇳🇬\\nRecovaPRO\\nIntegration options\\nOn this page\\nIntegration options\\nThis guide facilitates merchants in seamlessly integrating RecovaPRO into their digital applications, enabling them to secure full consent, establish secure electronic direct debit mandates, and initiate protected direct debit payments from their customers' bank accounts. Once the integration process is finalized, merchants gain the capability to generate secure and consented electronic mandates and initiate both scheduled and one-time debit payments directly from their customer's bank accounts. To integrate RecovaPRO into your web or mobile app, the following steps need to be taken for\\nactivation\\n:\\nSetup your Profile on the dedicated SaaS Portal\\nSelect your use case\\nSetup Payouts method\\nSelect additional “opt-in” services (if desired)\\nEnable Dispute Management correspondences - coming soon\\nConfigure Webhook settings for RecovaPRO events\\nEnable your choice of Advanced notification system (email | webhook | SMS | WhatsApp) - coming soon\\nStart using the Web Portal or start integrating the SDK or APIs using our sample data before switching to using real customer information.\\nAs always, our Product Engineering Support is just an email or a ping away 😉.\\nSDK\\n\\u200b\\nThe CreditChek RecovaPRO SDK employs secured & robust vanilla JavaScript technology that enables faster digital integration for any merchant who desires swift tailor-made solution integration for their customers, which includes secured, automated consented electronic mandate setup capabilities, detailed repayment breakdown, and payment schedule from customer’s bank account(s) directly into their existing digital products or applications.\\nAPI\\n\\u200b\\nThe CreditChek RecovaPRO API provides comprehensive endpoints for many forms of digital lending or post-paid service activities to seamlessly integrate secured and reliable automated direct debit functionalities into their platforms and products, through electronic consent or mandates, reliable manual or automated repayment scheduling(collection), onward settlements, and credit-risk management to protect your business and ensure it thrives.\\nCategories of e-Mandates\\n\\u200b\\nTo accommodate diverse lending merchants and post-paid services use cases, an e-mandate could be either of the following;\\nVariable\\n\\u200b\\nThis offers convenience for both businesses and customers, as it allows for automatic payments to be made without the need for manual intervention or invoice reconciliation. This type of e-mandate covers direct debit arrangements that often require the customer to authorize the merchant or service provider to withdraw funds directly from their bank account, either on an ongoing basis or for specific transactions. This automated arrangement includes the frequency of payments and the maximum or total amounts that can be debited throughout the agreed lifetime of the e-mandate arrangement. However, customers need to monitor their bank statements regularly to ensure that the debited amounts are accurate and authorized.\\nFixed\\n\\u200b\\nFixed direct debit arrangements are commonly used for recurring payments, such as rent, mortgage payments, insurance premiums, subscription services, loan repayments, and membership fees. By setting up fixed direct debit payments, customers can automate their recurring financial obligations, ensuring they are paid on time without manual intervention. It outlines the terms and conditions of the payment arrangement, including the frequency of payments and the fixed amount to be debited for each transaction.\\ne-Mandates Authorization\\n\\u200b\\nFor benefits of flexibility and convenience, there are two(2) ways e-mandates requests are created and authorized on the platform, largely influenced by how the target (debtors) bank accepts honouring such request on record:\\nMicro-deposit\\n\\u200b\\nAccepting a time-bound, real-time inflow of NGN50 from the target customer's bank account into an auto-generated bank account, which serves as full authorization to consent and place the e-Mandate on the debtor’s bank record. The transfer must be successful within an hour, or else the request with e-Mandate placement expires. e-Mandate authorised with this method typically gets auto-approved within 24 hours.\\nRequest parameters\\nName\\nPosition\\nRequired\\nDescription\\ntoken\\nHeaders\\nTrue\\napp public key\\nPOST:\\nhttps://api.creditchek.africa/v1/recova/micro-deposit/bank-list\\n💡 Supported banks for micro-deposit\\nFIRST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC\\nUNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC\\nGUARANTY TRUST BANK PLC\\nACCESS BANK PLC\\nZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC\\nEcoBank Plc\\nFIDELITY BANK PLC\\nFIRST CITY MONUMENT BANK PLC\\nGlobus Bank Ltd\\nJAIZ Bank\\nKEYSTONE BANK PLC\\nPOLARIS BANK LIMITED\\nProvidus Bank\\nStanbic IBTC\\nSTANDARD CHARTERED BANK PLC\\nSTERLING BANK PLC\\nSUNTRUST BANK\\nTAJBank Ltd\\nTITAN TRUST BANK\\nUnited Bank for Africa Plc\\nUNITY BANK PLC\\nWema Bank\\ne-Signature\\n\\u200b\\nThis involves the debtor/payer electronically appending their signature to match the signature recognized by the debtor’s bank on record (or file).

A payer's(customer) collection schedule can be specified when the payer is created and can be changed by updating the payer record.\\nRecovaPRO (Direct Debit) collection mode is of two types:\\nAutomated\\n\\u200b\\nThis option facilitates full charge of all debit (pull) collection directly from your customer’s bank account on the assigned due date automatically with the help of our smart automated debit system engineered to enforce dependable collection from all associated bank accounts (primary and backups) on record in association with the customer’s BVN and ‘active’ e-mandate. The debit(pull) transaction trigger is explicitly dependent on the active status, frequency, start date, end date, and debit due date of the consented e-mandate.\\nManual\\n\\u200b\\nThis option serves as a reliable backup debt recovery tool for diverse merchants where the e-mandate can be created, and approved with active status over a defined agreed period, but only triggered explicitly by the merchant from your digital platform when the need arises to rely on our dependable scheduler(collection system) to initiate the recovery of funds directly from your customers(debtors) bank accounts within the limits of the direct debit arrangement.\\nThis facilitates full control to the merchant on if/when such debit can happen as long as the e-mandate is active, within the arrangement validity period, and the total outstanding amount limit on record.\\nDirect Debit guarantee\\nYour customers (payers) are entitled to an immediate refund for any payments that shouldn’t have been taken (dispute such transactions through chargeback fees).\\nAdvance Notification System (coming soon)\\n\\u200b\\nTo comply with the Direct Debit scheme guidelines as defined by the Central (Apex) Bank, it is important to serve advance notice within 14 days of the debit due date to your customer(debtor) which is automatically transmitted at least 24 hours before the debit transaction is executed.\\nYour customers (payers) must be told the amount and date of each payment in advance.\\nThe platform has the following options to be enabled for your RecovaPRO merchant profile:\\nEmail (Free for all merchants)\\nSMS (Charges applies)\\nWhatsApp (Charges applies)\\nWebhook Notification (Free for all merchants. Can be automated to as part of your workflow to appear in the transaction activity or history or in-app push-notification about the scheduled, successful, and failed debit)\\nRecovaPRO Automated Notification Preference (coming soon)\\n\\u200b\\nTo enable the preferred automated email notification system for each mandate-related event required to be sent to the merchant and payer respectively on most transactions(including Advanced Notification before debt collection).\\nTIP\\nIf the Advance Notification before debt collection is disabled for Payers, Webhook MUST be used as an alternative and as it is required by the Direct Debit Scheme regulated by the central bank to notify any payer within 14 days before any debit is performed on an active e-mandate.\\nPayouts (onward settlements)\\n\\u200b\\nAll businesses (merchants) require a dependable method for ensuring the receipt of all recuperated merchant funds to sustain ongoing expansion reliably. Thus, it is easier to provide more credits, recover, “rinse, and repeat” without hassle when onward settlement is reliable and available during operational hours. Our platform allows merchants to request electronic payouts every Monday through Saturday (9 am to 6 pm). It guarantees to get funds in the setup or desired destination bank account (taxes and surcharges excluded) within an SLA(service level agreement) of two hours.\\nRecovaPRO Webhook event types (coming soon)\\n\\u200b\\nFor most merchants using the SDK and API integration, we have gone the extra mile to facilitate automating your digital system with RecovaPRO, these asynchronous communications are vital to enforcing desired automated workflows to improve the overall customer experience, and they include the following:\\nThese are webhook events that are triggered when RecovaPRO async operations or actions are executed. We have itemized them down below for your reference:\\nMandate created event.\\nMandate expired event.\\nMandate rejected event.\\nMandate approved event.\\nMandate paused event.\\nMandate canceled event.\\nMandate reinstated event.\\nMandate advance notification event.\\nDebit successful event.\\nDebit failed event.\\nLast updated\\non\\nFeb 10, 2025\\nPrevious\\nOverview\\nNext\\nAPI\\nSDK\\nAPI\\nCategories of e-Mandates\\nVariable\\nFixed\\ne-Mandates Authorization\\nMicro-deposit\\ne-Signature\\ne-Mandates Debit types\\nOne-time\\nRecurring\\nScheduler (Automated debit collection system)\\nAutomated\\nManual\\nAdvance Notification System (coming soon)\\nRecovaPRO Automated Notification Preference (coming soon)\\nPayouts (onward settlements)\\nRecovaPRO Webhook event types (coming soon)\\nHelp\\nYouTube\\nEmail\\nCommunity\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nMore\\nBlog\\nCopyright © 2025 CreditChek Inc.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.creditchek.africa/category/api'}, page_content='API | CreditChek Docs\\nSkip to main content\\nDocs\\nBlog\\nGitHub\\nIntroduction\\nAuthentication\\nWebhooks\\nCredit Assessment SDK\\nNigeria 🇳🇬\\nIdentity Service\\nIncome Service\\nCredit Insights\\nRadar Service\\nERM\\nRecovaPRO\\nOverview\\nIntegration options\\nAPI\\nSystem status\\nStep 1: Initialize mandate\\nStep 2: Set mandate\\nStep 3: Verify mandate\\nManual collection\\nOther actions\\nKenya 🇰🇪\\nNigeria 🇳🇬\\nRecovaPRO\\nAPI\\nAPI\\nA faster, more reliable, and more secure way to recover debts and payments from customers without entering their debit or credit card details..\\n📄️\\nSystem status\\nYou can make this call from your code, a REST client, or your postman using your live credentials.

      "* **Asynchronous Function:** Uses `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Install Dependencies:** `npm install axios dotenv`\n",

      " ```\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " **Explanation:**\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 1. **Import Modules:**\n",
      "  - `axios`:  For making HTTP requests.\n",
      "  - `dotenv`: To load environment variables from a `.env` file (for secure API key management).\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 2. **Base URL:**\n",
      "  - `baseURL`:  Set to the CreditChek API base URL (`https://api.creditchek.africa/v2`).\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 3. **API Token:**\n",
      "  - `apiToken`:  Retrieves the API token from the environment variable `CREDITCHEK_API_TOKEN` using `process.env.CREDITCHEK_API_TOKEN`.  **Important:** Store your API token securely in an environment variable and **never** hardcode it in your code or commit it to your repository.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 4. **Axios Instance:**\n",
      "  - `creditChekAPI`: Creates an Axios instance with pre-configured settings:\n",
      "  - `baseURL`: Sets the base URL for all requests.\n",
      "  - `timeout`: Sets a timeout for requests (e.g., 10000 milliseconds).\n",
      "  - `headers`: Sets the default headers for all requests:\n",
      "  - `Authorization`:  Sets the `Authorization` header to `Bearer ${apiToken}`. This is how you authenticate with the CreditChek API.\n",
      "  - `Content-Type`: Sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`, indicating that you're sending JSON data.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 5. **`fetchData` Function:**\n",
      "  - This is an example function that encapsulates the API request logic.\n",
      "  - It takes the `endpoint` and `params` as arguments.\n",
      "  - It uses `creditChekAPI.get()` to make a GET request to the specified endpoint with the provided parameters.  You can adapt this to use `creditChekAPI.post()`, `creditChekAPI.put()`, `creditChekAPI.delete()`, etc., for other HTTP methods as needed.\n",
      "  - **Error Handling:**  It includes comprehensive error handling:\n",
      "  - It checks the `response.status` code to ensure the request was successful (200 OK).\n",
      "  - It catches any errors that occur during the request (e.g., network errors, API errors).\n",
      "  - It logs detailed error information, including the response data, status code, and headers (if available).\n",
      "  - It re-throws the error so that the calling function can handle it appropriately.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 6. **`main` Function:**\n",
      "  - This is an example of how to use the `fetchData` function.\n",
      "  - It calls `fetchData` with a sample endpoint and parameters.\n",
      "  - It logs the API response data to the console.\n",
      "  - It catches any errors that occur during the data fetching process.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " **To use this code:**\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 1. **Install Dependencies:**\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  npm install axios dotenv\n",
      "  ```\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 2. **Set up Environment Variables:**\n",
      "  - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.\n",
      "  - Add your CreditChek API token to the `.env` file:\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  CREDITCHEK_API_TOKEN=your_actual_api_token\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  - **Important:**  Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent your API token from being committed to your repository.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 3. **Replace Placeholders:**\n",
      "  - Replace `/some_endpoint` with the actual CreditChek API endpoint you want to call.\n",
      "  - Replace `{ /* your parameters */ }` with the actual parameters you want to send to the API.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " 4. **Run the Code:**\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  node your_script_name.js\n",
      "  ```\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " **Key Points:**\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " * **Security:**  Always store your API token securely in an environment variable.\n",
      " * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and handle potential issues.\n",
      " * **Flexibility:**  Adapt the `fetchData` function to use different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and to handle different API endpoints and parameters.\n",
      " * **Asynchronous Operations:**  Use `async/await` to handle asynchronous API requests in a clean and readable way.\n",
      " * **Content Type:**  Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` when sending JSON data to the API.\n",
      " * **Bearer Token:** Use the `Bearer` scheme in the `Authorization` header to authenticate with the API.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " This comprehensive example provides a solid foundation for interacting with the CreditChek API in your Node.js applications.  Remember to consult the CreditChek API documentation for specific endpoint details, request parameters, and response formats.\n"

Make sure you have the `dotenv` package installed and a `.env` file with `CREDITCHEK_API_TOKEN` defined.\\n  - **Error Handling:** It checks if the API token is available and throws an error if it\\'s not set.\\n  - **Configure Axios:** It creates an Axios instance with:\\n  - `baseURL`:  Set to the CreditChek API base URL.\\n  - `headers`:  Sets the `token` header with the API token.  Also sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json`.\\n  - **Make API Request:** It uses `axios.post` to make a POST request to the specified endpoint with the provided data.  You can change this to `axios.get`, `axios.put`, `axios.delete`, etc., depending on the API endpoint requirements.\\n  - **Handle Response:** It logs the successful response data and returns it.\\n  - **Error Handling:** It includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the API request.  It logs detailed error information, including the response data and status code if available. It also re-throws the error so that the calling function can handle it.\\n \\n\\n 4. **`main` Function (Example Usage):**\\n  - This `async` function demonstrates how to use the `creditChekRequest` function.\\n  - **Define Endpoint and Data:**  Replace `/your_endpoint` with the actual API endpoint you want to call and provide the necessary request data.\\n  - **Call API:** It calls the `creditChekRequest` function to make the API request.\\n  - **Handle Result:** It logs the API result.\\n  - **Error Handling:** It includes a `try...catch` block to handle errors in the `main` function.\\n \\n\\n 5. **Execute `main` Function:**\\n  - The `main()` function is called to start the process.\\n \\n\\n **To use this code:**\\n \\n\\n 1. **Install Dependencies:**\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install axios dotenv\\n  ```\\n \\n\\n 2. **Create a `.env` file:**\\n  - In the root of your project, create a `.env` file and add your CreditChek API token:\\n  ```\\n  CREDITCHEK_API_TOKEN=your_actual_api_token\\n  ```\\n  **Important:** Replace `your_actual_api_token` with your actual API token from the CreditChek dashboard.\\n \\n\\n 3. **Replace Placeholder Values:**\\n  - In the `main` function, replace `/your_endpoint` with the actual API endpoint you want to call.\\n  - Replace the example `requestData` with the actual data you need to send to the API.\\n \\n\\n 4. **Run the Code:**\\n  ```bash\\n  node your_script_name.js\\n  ```\\n  (Replace `your_script_name.js` with the name of your JavaScript file.)\\n \\n\\n **Key improvements and best practices:**\\n \\n\\n * **Environment Variables:**  The API token is now loaded from an environment variable, which is the recommended way to store sensitive information.  Never hardcode your API token directly in your code.\\n * **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling is included to catch potential issues during the API request and provide informative error messages.  The error handling now includes logging the response data and status code if available, which can be very helpful for debugging.\\n * **Axios Instance:**  An Axios instance is created to configure the base URL and headers.  This makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain.\\n * **`async/await`:**  The code uses `async/await` to make the asynchronous API calls more readable and easier to follow.\\n * **Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain each step.\\n * **Re-throwing Errors:** The `creditChekRequest` function re-throws the error after logging it. This allows the calling function (e.g., `main`) to handle the error as well.  This is important for proper error propagation.\\n * **Clearer Error Messages:** The error messages are more descriptive and include information about the potential causes of the errors.\\n * **Content-Type Header:** The `Content-Type` header is explicitly set to `application/json`.\\n * **Security:**  The code emphasizes the importance of securing your API keys and not committing them to Git.\\n * **Adherence to Documentation:** The code uses the header name `token` as specified in the CreditChek documentation.\\n \\n\\n This revised response provides a complete and secure solution for authenticating with the CreditChek API in Node.js, following best practices and addressing potential issues.
